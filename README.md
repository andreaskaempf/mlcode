# Machine learning and data science in Go

This is a codebase of machine learning and data science libraries
in Go. It will initially cover linear and logistic regression, and
simple neural networks. It uses gonum for matrices.

This is a set of focused utility functions, and not intended to replace
golearn, goml, or other mature Go libraries.
